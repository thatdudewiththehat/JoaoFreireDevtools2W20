Pave recipe 

	Ingredients

		Creamy layers
		2 cans of sweetened condensed milk (14 oz each)
		4 cups milk (Whole milk preferred)
		2 tbsp corn starch
		4 egg yolks
		Â¼ tsp vanilla
		Top Layer (whipped cream topping)
		2 cups Heavy Cream
		2 cups powdered sugar
		1 tsp pure vanilla extract
		Marias cookies (from the Latin food section) or lady fingers
		Chocolate Bar (optional)
		Sliced bananas (optional)
		strawberries (optional)
		chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)

Instructions

		In large pot whisk together condensed milk, 3 cups milk, egg yolks, and vanilla
		In measuring flask or small bowl whisk together last cup of milk with corn starch until dissolved
		Heat the mixture in sauce pan over medium/low heat stirring continuously (this will burn if you do not watch it closely and keep stirring)
		Once the mixture is bubbling slowly mix in the final cup of milk with cornstarch while continuing to stir
		Remove from heat once it has thickened to a pudding like consistency
		Pour into 15 x 10 baking dish and use rubber spatula to spread evenly over the bottom of the dish
		Place 1 layer of Maria cookies (or lady fingers) over cream until completely covered
		If you want to add fruit to the Pave (I like sliced strawberries and bananas in mine) then add a layer of sliced fruit on top of the cookies before adding more cream
		Then add another layer of cream over that and repeat with another layer of Marias cookies, and another layer of fruit ( if desired)
		Whipped cream topping
		In bowl mix together heavy cream, powdered sugar and vanilla til it turns into a heavy whipping cream
		Spread across the top of the Pave with a rubber spatula
		Cover with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerate over night ( if you do not have overnight I'd recommend letting it sit in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours...it tastes much better after it has been refrigerated for several hours)
		When ready to serve you can serve as is, or sprinkle on nuts or grated chocolate over the top
		To make grated chocolate you can just buy a Hershey's chocolate bar or chocolate bar of choice. Place the chocolate bar in the freezer for a couple hours and then use a cheese grater to grate the chocolate over the top of your Pave
